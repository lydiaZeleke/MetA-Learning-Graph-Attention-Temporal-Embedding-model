# MAL-GATE: Meta-Learning Graph Attention Temporal Embedding for Anomaly Detection

MAL-GATE is a Python-based framework for anomaly detection that leverages meta-learning and graph attention networks. This model is designed to capture temporal dependencies and graph-based relationships in data, making it highly effective for detecting anomalies in dynamic systems.

## Overview

MAL-GATE combines:
- **Meta-Learning**: To adapt quickly to new tasks with limited data.
- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: To model relationships between entities in graph-structured data.
- **Temporal Embedding**: To capture time-dependent patterns for anomaly detection.

This framework is ideal for applications such as fraud detection, network monitoring, and predictive maintenance.

## Features
- Meta-learning for fast adaptation to new datasets.
- Graph attention mechanisms for relational modeling.
- Temporal embedding for sequential data analysis.
- GPU-accelerated training and inference.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
